# Stardew Marriage Speedrun Resources

This repository is a comprehensive collection of route notes and resources for Stardew Valley marriage speedruns. These notes are designed to be as beginner-friendly as possible. You should be able to start a marriage speedrun with next to no knowledge of Stardew speedrunning.

## Getting Started

Using the left hand navigation, go into the [routes](./routes) folder and find route notes for whichever partner you are interested. All route notes contain a `Required Tech` section explaining the speedtech you will need to learn in order to complete that run.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between routes labeled `beginner`, `intermediate` or `advanced`?

The route notes in this collection are divided into 3 categories: `beginner`, `intermediate`, and `advanced`. Advanced runs are only slightly more difficult to execute than beginner runs; the distinction actually comes from how much you will need to reset to be successful with that route.

- `Beginner` routes require no resetting. You can complete a beginner run regardless of what RNG the game gives you.
- `Intermediate` routes require some early game resetting. Examples include resetting for a golden quality parsnip in your first crop harvest, or resetting for a specific rain pattern in spring. An intermediate route will typically be around 5-10 minutes faster than a beginner route.
- `Advanced` routes require a significant amount of resetting, and potentially late in the run. Examples include resetting for specific bulletin board quests, or getting a specific person at the feast of the winter star. An advanced route will typically be around 3-5 minutes faster than an intermediate route.

### What is the difference between Vanilla and Glitchless?

The speedrun.com leaderboards have two main "No major glitches" categories: `Vanilla` and `Glitchless`. The only difference between them is that `Glitchless` allows the use of "animation cancelling", which is a speedtech that allows you to swing your tools more quickly. In `Vanilla`, animation cancelling is not allowed.

### Do I need to use animation cancelling?

No. All of these route notes are written with the `Vanilla` ruleset in mind, which disallows animation cancelling. Of course, you can use these route notes for glitchless runs as well.
