# Rain Prediction

Rain prediction is tech which allows the weather to be predicted years in advance. This tech can be done on patch 1.6 with legacy RNG enabled only.

## Overview

Rain prediction is very straightforward. On patch 1.6 sunny and rainy days are determined entirely by your game seed. That is to say, as soon as you create a new farm, the game has already determined which days will be sunny or rainy for the entire lifetime of your farm and nothing that you do in game can affect this (besides rain totems). On patch 1.5 and below, rain RNG is affected by the number of steps that you take, so simply moving around will change future rain patterns, making it unfeasible to predict rain in a speedrun setting.

On patch 1.6, if we can narrow down our game seed enough by observing RNG phenomenons on our farm, we can predict future rain patterns *very* accurately. This allows us to set up proposal days that suit our needs (since the mermaid's pendant can only be purchased in rain). It turns out that this can typically be done very early in runs by simply observing the rain patterns that occur in early Spring.

## Example

If it rains on Spring 7th AND Spring 26th (Year 1) then it is guaranteed to rain on Spring 27th (Year 2). In an Emily marriage speedrun, Spring 27th, year 2 is the day that we want to propose (as it is Emilys birthday). So in an Emily Marriage speedrun, we would reset any run where it was sunny on the 7th or 26th, guaranteeing us to get the rain in year 2 on the date that we want.

## Do it yourself
