# Mail Manipulation

Mail manipulation is tech which allows us to get specific gifts in the mail from NPCs, which can be used as gifts.

## Overview

Mail manipulation is very simple. After sleeping for a long period of time, NPCs are very likely to have sent you gifts in the mail. Each NPC can send a random assortment of gifts, as explained in the "Repeatable Gifts" section on the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Letters).
These gifts are completely random. However, they will change each time you read the mail. So if you receive a gift that you do not want, simply quitting to the title screen, reloading your save file, and checking the mail another time will re-randomize the gifts.

Note that the number of gifts received and who they are from will never change via resetting.

## Example

Emily loves both wool and cloth. When friends with Emily, she can send you wool, cloth, and sea urchins in the mail. We rely on the wool and cloth as gifts for Emily. Therefore, the route notes for Emily read as follows:

```
### Winter 12, Y1
- Read all mail, reset for loved gifts if necessary
...
```

which simply means that if you received a bunch of sea urchins, you should reset the day and try to get better mail gifts instead.
