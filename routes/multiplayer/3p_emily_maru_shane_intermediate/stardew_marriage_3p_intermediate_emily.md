# 3 Player Marriage (Emily / Maru / Shane) Emily Notes

To be paired with [Maru Notes](./stardew_marriage_3p_intermediate_maru.md) and [Shane Notes](./stardew_marriage_3p_intermediate_shane.md)

## Required Tech
- [Winter Forage Farming](../../../tech/winter_forage_farming.md)
- [Crate Manipulation](../../../tech/crate_manipulation.md)
- [Parsnip Punching](../../../tech/parsnip_punching.md)
- [Mail Manipulation](../../../tech/mail_manipulation.md)

## Setup

Maru Player should host the file  
Play as: Girl  

## Miscellaneous notes

Emily loves:
- Amethyst, topaz, and other gems
- Survival Burger (which can be found in crates on the beach farm)
- Wool and Cloth (which Emily will send you in the mail)

Unlike most marriage routes which collect a consistent amount of gifts, all of Emily's gifts come from random sources. You'll need to use your judgement to decide if you have enough gifts or if you should spend time resetting mail or mining. Keep the following in mind:
- You need only 3 gifts total + 1 amethyst for the entire run
- You need at least 1 amethyst for quest purposes, do not leave the mines without one
- On Spring 27, Y1, 1 gift + 1 amethyst is usually good enough
- On Winter 9, when checking mail, you need 2 gifts + 1 amethyst total to finish the run, but you can also check beach crates and possibly get more mail as late as Spring 27, Y2

Other notes:
- In early spring and summer, the only resources you care about are wood and sap (for fertilizer). All other resources can be tossed. 
- After summer, Y1, only wood is needed
- Forage should be grabbed whenever possible and stashed in the chest
- Coffee should be used on winter 9th and 11th to speed up winter forage farming
- 1 coffee and 1 pepper poppers should be saved for Spring 27, Y2
