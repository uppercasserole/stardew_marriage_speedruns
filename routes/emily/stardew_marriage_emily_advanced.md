# Emily Marriage 

No video of run :(

## Required Tech
- [Winter Forage Farming](../../tech/winter_forage_farming.md)
- [Crate Manipulation](../../tech/crate_manipulation.md)
- [Parsnip Punching](../../tech/parsnip_punching.md)
- [Mail Manipulation](../../tech/mail_manipulation.md)
- [Rain Prediction](../../tech/rain_prediction.md)

## Setup

Play as: Girl  
Farm: Beach Farm  
Patch: 1.6 with Legacy RNG

## Miscellaneous notes

Emily loves
- Amethyst, topaz, and other gems
- Survival Burger (which can be found in crates on the beach farm)
- Wool and Cloth (which Emily will send you in the mail)

Unlike most marriage routes which collect a consistent amount of gifts, all of Emily's gifts come from random sources. You'll need to use your judgement to decide if you have enough gifts or if you should spend time extra time mining or resetting mail. Keep the following in mind:
- You need 6 gifts total + 1 amethyst for the entire run.
- You can get away with TWO liked gifts as long as they are not given on a birthday (Spring 27) and everything else is loved. Emily likes both quartz and daffodils which are easy to come by. Picking up two daffodils near the community center on Spring 27, Y1 is almost required.
- You need at least 1 amethyst for quest purposes, do not leave the mines without one.
- On Spring 27, Y1, 2 loved gifts + 1 amethyst is usually good enough to finish the run with mail and crates, 3 gifts + 1 amethyst is very good.
- On Winter 12, when checking mail, you need 4 gifts + 1 amethyst to get through winter, reset mail if you do not have enough.

This route requires us to get one "Help Wanted" quest from the bulletin board from Emily. We get 4 checks of the bulletin board on the 4 days in winter that we do winter forage farming. Consider trying to hold on to an earth crystal and quartz from the mines, as Emily can ask for those. Ideally, she asks for winter forage.

If she asks for a fish, these are the fish that can be caught on your first cast in the mornings:
- Herring, Ocean
- Sardine, Ocean
- Red Mullet, Ocean
- Tuna, Ocean
- Perch, River
- Pike, River

If you don't catch it on your first cast, give up. It may be correct to just ignore fish quests altogether as they likely to lose a fair amount of time.
