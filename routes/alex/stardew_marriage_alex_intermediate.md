## Required Tech
- [Winter Forage Farming](../../tech/winter_forage_farming.md)
- [Golden Crop Manipulation](../../tech/golden_crop_manipulation.md)

## Setup

Play as: Girl  
Farm: Beach Farm  
Patch: 1.6 with Legacy RNG

## Miscellaneous notes

This route takes advantage of specific dialogue options that Alex gives on Wednesdays in spring, summer and fall. Unfortunately, there is a 2.5% chance that whenever you talk to Alex, he will tell you about one of his relatives likes or dislikes instead. If this happens, you will need to go out on an extra day and gift one of the leftover regular parsnips.
